# Mock-Inteview
## How the mock interview improved my interview skills
Before I took part in a mock interview through my classwork, I had a role as an it technician trainee at a repair center. 
Although I had already secured the position, the mock interview was incredibly valuable in helping me prepare for what to expect in a real working environment. 
It gave me the opportunity to practice speaking professionally, respond to technical and situational questions confidently and reflect on how to present my academic knowledge in a more practical way. 
Although I had not received feedback, I consulted my fellow students to help me refine my communication style, improve my ability to stay composed under pressure and identify areas where I could be clearer or more concise. 
As a result, when I stepped into the repair centre for the first time, I felt much more confident when interacting with colleagues and supervisors. The mock interview gave me a better understanding of how to carry myself professionally and respond to unexpected questions or challenges, which helped me settle into the workplace more quickly and make a positive first impression.
